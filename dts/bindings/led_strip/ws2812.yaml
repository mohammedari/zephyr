  Worldsemi WS2812 (and compatible) LED controller

  Driver bindings for daisy chains of WS2812 (and compatible devices
  like SK6812) LED controllers.

  The PWM protocol is described here:
  https://wp.josh.com/2014/05/13/ws2812-neopixels-are-not-so-finicky-once-you-get-to-know-them/

  A 0 bit's pulse width is between 200 and 500 ns. A 1 bit's is
  at least 550 ns, with 700 ns or so typical. Pixel order is GRB.

  You can connect the device to either a GPIO on your SoC, or a SPI
  MOSI line. Use the worldsemi,ws2812-spi.yaml or
  worldsemi,ws2812-gpio.yaml bindings instead of this file after
  making your choice.

properties:
  chain-length:
    type: int
    required: true

      The number of devices in the daisy-chain.

  color-mapping:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Channel to color mapping (or pixel order).

      For example a GRB channel to color mapping would be

         color-mapping = <LED_COLOR_ID_GREEN
                          LED_COLOR_ID_RED
                          LED_COLOR_ID_BLUE>;
